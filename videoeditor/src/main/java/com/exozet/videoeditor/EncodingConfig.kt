 *
 * The frames in your H.264 video are grouped into units called [GOP]s (Group Of Pictures). Inside these GOPs frames are classified into three types:
 *
 * [I-frame]: frame that stores the whole picture
 * [P-frame]: frame that stores only the changes between the current picture and previous ones
 * [B-frame]: frame that stores differences with previous or future pictures
 *
 * Additionally, I-frames can be classified as IDR frames and non-IDR frames.
 *
 * The difference is that frames following an IDR frame cannot reference any frame that comes before the IDR frame, while in the case of a non-IDR frame there are no limitations.
 *
 * Every GOP starts with an I-frame, also called a keyframe, but may contain more than one. To create further confusion,
 * a GOP can start with an IDR frame or with a non-IDR frame. This means that frames in the GOP can sometimes refer to previous GOPs (in this case the GOP is said to be "open"),
 * and sometimes not (in this case it's closed).
 *
 * It's common to see the structure of a GOP represented as in this example: [IBBBPBBBPBBBI]. Here the length of the the GOP is 12 frames, with 3 B-frames between each P-frame.
